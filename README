elist_monitor
written by Kurt J. Strosahl (strosahl@jlab.org)

The purpose of this script is to read the output from ipmitool sel elist and send any messages from the last day to
the syslog of the local host.
This is to allow the messages from the cluster to be collected in our central logger (a graylog system).

It requires python3 to run. all packages are part of a standard python deployment.
